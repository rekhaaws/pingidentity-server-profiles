# Splunk Logging Sample Configurations

This folder contains PingAccess and PingFederate log4j configuration for use with Ping helm deployments.  These files provide a sample for formatting logs from these products for use in Splunk.  Your own configuration may vary, depending on your needs and situation.

The guide for using these profiles with a local instance of Splunk is located at on the [Devops portal](https://devops.pingidentity.com/how-to/splunkLogging/).

Thanks to [Samir Gandhi]( https://github.com/samir-gandhi/server-profiles) for his work on these files.
